# business_canvas_simulator
A Business canvas simulator with an example

Business canvas can be greatly improved on two sides :
- Be more precise on business descriptions, express more details
- Incorporate business rules so that the business model can be simulated with figures.

We use Insightmaker (https://insightmaker.com/) to create business canvas and inject business rules which can be simulated.

We provide :
- An empty template that you can use to start your brand new project
- A car rental business canvas as an example of what can be achieved.

The InsightMaker software present on Github seems not updated and we have creates an account on https://insightmaker.com/ to produce the above delivrables.

Our deliverables are placed under Apache 2.0 licence.
